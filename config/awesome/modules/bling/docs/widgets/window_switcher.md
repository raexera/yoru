### Usage

To enable:

```lua
bling.widget.window_switcher.enable {
    type = "thumbnail", -- set to anything other than "thumbnail" to disable client previews

    -- keybindings (the examples provided are also the default if kept unset)
    hide_window_switcher_key = "Escape", -- The key on which to close the popup
    minimize_key = "n",                  -- The key on which to minimize the selected client
    unminimize_key = "N",                -- The key on which to unminimize all clients
    kill_client_key = "q",               -- The key on which to close the selected client
    cycle_key = "Tab",                   -- The key on which to cycle through all clients
    previous_key = "Left",               -- The key on which to select the previous client
    next_key = "Right",                  -- The key on which to select the next client
    vim_previous_key = "h",              -- Alternative key on which to select the previous client
    vim_next_key = "l",                  -- Alternative key on which to select the next client

    cycleClientsByIdx = awful.client.focus.byidx,               -- The function to cycle the clients
    filterClients = awful.widget.tasklist.filter.currenttags,   -- The function to filter the viewed clients
}
```

To run the window swicher you have to emit this signal from within your configuration (usually using a keybind).

```lua
awesome.emit_signal("bling::window_switcher::turn_on")
```

For example:
```lua
 awful.key({Mod1}, "Tab", function()
     awesome.emit_signal("bling::window_switcher::turn_on")
 end, {description = "Window Switcher", group = "bling"})
```
